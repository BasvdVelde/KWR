R scripts for KWR research project

Dear reader,

The "Spectral and structural similarity" folder contains the R-script developed to calculated the NDP, 
JI, Spearman's/Pearson's correlations. It also provides the code to calculate the different approaches 
and the structural similarity using the Maccs chemical fingerprint


The "other" folder contains R codes used to aid the project, such as merging the spectra and saving the JSON
files extracted from the MASSBANK database

The R-scripts used for the rapid sand filtration (RSF) with metolachlor spiked-in can be found in the "RSF" folder.
The "SandfiltrationTP.R" file contains the patRoon code used. The .Rprof contains the calculated values with patRoon

The same applies for the activated carbon filtration (ACF) filter 1 and 2 and are in seperate folders in the "ACF" folder.
